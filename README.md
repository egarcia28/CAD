## CAD_PullCopter

### Description
I, as student B (Student A was [Josiah Patterson](https://github.com/jpatter43/CircuitPython)), created both the spinner and prop. The spinner had gear teeth on it so it could spin when it interacted with key. And the prop had the same pattern as the spinner so it could fit and fly. The more notable tools used to create these parts are, sweep, helix, circualar pattern, part studio in context, and branching.

#### 4.1 Teamwork Makes the Dreamwork

##### Description
For this section of the assignmnet the goal for me (student b) was to create the spinner that would then fit into the ring, and be rotated by the key created by student A([Josiah Patterson](https://github.com/jpatter43/CircuitPython)) in both section 4.1 and 4.2.

_The Spinner_
##### Reflection
I found that creating the spinner was relatively straight forward with the only new tool used being the "new part studio in context" and "helix" both of which I found really helpful and will most definitly be using in the future.

#### 4.2 Teamwork! Key and Prop

##### Description
For this section of the assignmnet the goal for me (student b) was to create the prop that the spinner would rotate and launch.

_The Prop and Spinner_
##### Reflection
Creating the prop, although no new tools were used, came with it's own challenges for me. For example, the center of the prop was incorrect ar first, due to some bad merge scopes and sketches.
#### 4.3 Teamwork! Assembling the Launcher

##### Description
The goal for this section of the assignment was to assemble all of the parts we had made up to this point into the final pull copter. The spinner sat in between the top and the ring and the key slid into the top and formed a rack and pinion with the spinner, finally the prop sat on top of the spinner and moved with it so that when the key was pulled it would fly

_Our Pull Copter Assembly_

_The Rack and Pinion Interaction between the Key and Spinner_
##### Reflection
Assembling the pull copter was very simple, and we only used tools we had used before. One of the more interesting aspects of this assignment was finding the number of rotations the spinner made from one pull of the key.
#### 4.4 - 4.5 Branching and Merging

##### Description
For the last section, the goal was to learn and use versions and branches so that each partner could create their own prop design.

_My Edits to the Prop_
##### Reflection
For the personal edits to the prop, I added more prop blades and reduced their size in order to increase the lift produced. I also removed material from the bottom to decrease weight and hopefully increase the height it would launch.33

## CAD_SwingArm

### Description
For this assignment we were tasked to create a part with very few direct dimensions, the intent of the assignment to prepare for the onshape certification test where we will be given simmilar task. One of the more interesting aspects of this assighnment is the constraints which in combination with a few dimensions created a very clean and well designed part. The next step of this assignment was to change some dimensions to expose the weaknesses in your constraints.

_Step 2 Isometric_
### Reflection
When first building the swing arm, rather than focus on constraining the sketrch before dimensioning it, I did the opposite which led to alot of broken and overdefined constraints and dimensions. After this I restarted after I not-so-willingly let Mr. H delete my progress, but when I started only with constraints I made quick progress and had it done within the class.

## CAD_MultiPartStudio

### Description
The intent of this assignment, much like the swing arm was to prepare us for the onshape certification test. The goal of this assignment being to prepare for the multi-part studio aspect of the certification test. This specific practice was to model a vaccum pump, using a singular part studio. Similarlly to the swing arm, there were multiple steps/dimension changes to expose different waknesses/flaws in our design.

### Reflection
I ran into very few problems when first designing the multi-part studio, but when I went to change the dimensions, I encountered several problems and areas where my design was lacking. For exaple, when making the hole in the top and bottom for the cylinder, I had used a sketch and extrude, rather than a boolean.

## Onshape Certification

### Certification

### Reflection
 While practicing for the Onshape certification exam, I focused on what I though would be my weaknesses, namely the multipart design. I also did alot of practice on the single part studio assignments. I would say that for the most part, both of the practices I focused on really helped for the exam, because the questions on the exam were practically identical to those in the practices. Overall the exam itself was mostly straightforward and I was fairly confident in my ability to do well. I had a harder time than I expected on the multiple choice section, but the practice multiple choice helped me know what to expect. If I were to go through this process again, I would budget my time better, both on the actual test as well as a the practice, rather than spend time practicing things I was confident in, I should have spent more time on the stuff i was less confident in.
