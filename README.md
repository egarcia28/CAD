## CAD_PullCopter

### Description
I, as student B (Student A was [Josiah Patterson](https://github.com/jpatter43/CircuitPython)), created both the spinner and prop. The spinner had gear teeth on it so it could spin when it interacted with key. And the prop had the same pattern as the spinner so it could fit and fly. The more notable tools used to create these parts are, sweep, helix, and circualar pattern. Other than these tools, both of these parts were relatively straight forward and only a combination of sketches and extrudes.

Edits to prop

### Reflection
The spinner was relatively straight forward, other than the helix and sweep tools which were new to me. 

When making the prop, I ran into some trouble with the center of the prop but it was an easy fix, I just had to fix some of the merge scopes. 

For the personal edits to the prop, I added more prop blades and reduced their size in order to increase the lift produced.


## CAD_SwingArm

### Description
For this assignment we were tasked to create a part with very few direct dimensions, the intent of the assignment to prepare for the onshape certification test where we will be given simmilar task. One of the more interesting aspects of this assighnment is the constraints which in combination with a few dimensions created a very clean and well designed part. The next step of this assignment was to change some dimensions to expose the weaknesses in your constraints.

### Reflection
When first building the swing arm, rather than focus on constraining the sketrch before dimensioning it, I did the opposite which led to alot of broken and overdefined constraints and dimensions. After this I restarted after I not-so-willingly let Mr. H delete my progress, but when I started only with constraints I made quick progress and had it done within the class.

## CAD_MultiPartStudio

### Description
The intent of this assignment, much like the swing arm was to prepare us for the onshape certification test. The goal of this assignment being to prepare for the multi-part studio aspect of the certification test. This specific practice was to model a vaccum pump, using a singular part studio.
