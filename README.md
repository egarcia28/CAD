## CAD_PullCopter

### Description
I, as student B (Student A was [Josiah Patterson](https://github.com/jpatter43/CircuitPython)), created both the spinner and prop. The spinner had gear teeth on it so it could spin when it interacted with key. And the prop had the same pattern as the spinner so it could fit and fly. The more notable tools used to create these parts are, sweep, helix, and circualar pattern. Other than these tools, both of these parts were relatively straight forward and only a combination of sketches and extrudes.

### Reflection
The spinner was relatively straight forward, other than the helix and sweep tools which were new to me. When making the prop, I ran into some trouble with the center of the prop but it was an easy fix, I just had to fix some of the merge scopes. For the personal edits to the prop, I added more prop blades and reduced their size.
